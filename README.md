Data sourced exclusively from Bulbapedia · Gen I–VIII


Meant for simple, time-effective move lookups, if you do not want to have many tabs open during a Nuzlocke or casual playthrough.

Features:
- Lookup Movesets based on Level-Up, Tm/Hm, Breeding, and Tutoring based on choosen Generation / Game
- Basic information about every move, including Move	Type	Cat.	Pwr.	Acc.	PP
- Quick Pokemon name retrieval and autocompletion
- Save Multiple Pokemon (as many as you want) in a Roster to be featured in a sidebar for quick access

Upcoming Features:
- Sort Tables
- Individual Move lookup
- Extensive Move Descriptions
- Nuzlocke Functionality (Evolve Pokemon, Assign Nicknames & Movesets, tutor locations)

Still under development, expect following issues:
  - no gen 7 and 9 retrieval currently
  - gen 8 still does not feature Let's go Pikachu! / Eevee! information
  - no special moves, event moves or transfer moves from other generations (as those are typically unavailable for most players, especially in Nuzlocke runs)
